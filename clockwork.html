	<h3>About Clockwork</h3>	
	<p>We learned to work with clients in Game Design and Development 325. We were tasked by a Literature professor to develop a game based on the world of Hugo from the graphic novel and movie. This game was a project made by my group of 8 using Flash. My contributions for this game were design and also the enemies' pathing by using tweens. The game can be played and downloaded from <a href="http://gddgames.uwstout.edu/gdd/dev/games/_72_Clockwork_Hugo/Clockwork_Hugo.php?id=72">here.</a></p>
