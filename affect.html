	<h3>About Affect</h3>
	<p>Affect was a project made by my group in the Game Design and Development 450 and 451 classes. My group of 9 developed this game in Unity over the course of 2 semesters. My main contributions were to the level design, player death, player respawn, room resetting, geysers, water, vines, crank interaction, and bug fixes. The game can be played and downloaded from <a href="http://affectgame.com/">here.</a></p>
