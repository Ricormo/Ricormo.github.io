	<h3>About The Pink Cupcake Massacre</h3>
	<p>In Game Design and Development 101, we focused on a single project that I pitched. This game was made by a group of four in GameMaker. The game design and logic were done mostly by myself, but I of course had help from my group. The game can be played and downloaded from <a href="http://gddgames.uwstout.edu/gdd/dev/games/_40_Pink_Cupcake_Massacre/Pink_Cupcake_Massacre.php?id=40" style = "color:black underline:none">here.</a></p>
